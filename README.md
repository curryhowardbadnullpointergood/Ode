# ODE 

A **social media platform for music lovers** that connects people around live events.  
Event organizers can post about upcoming shows, and anyone who buys a ticket is automatically added to a group chat with other attendees. From there, users can create smaller group chats to meet new people and organize meetups before or after the event.  

This was developed as a group project — I personally built and designed the **entire frontend**.
